# 🚆 TEN-T Core Network Simulation  
### Interactive Transport Flow Model of the European Core Network

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **interactive simulation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) Core Network**.  
It models major European logistics hubs and transport corridors using a graph-based structure and visualizes freight flows dynamically on a web-based map.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

- Network modeling concepts  
- Flow simulation and capacity analysis  
- Routing and alternative path logic  
- Interactive visualization in a browser environment  

---

## 🌍 Motivation

The TEN-T network plays a crucial role in connecting Europe’s:

- 🚢 Ports  
- ✈️ Airports  
- 🚄 Rail corridors  
- 🏙 Major logistics hubs  

Understanding flow behavior, congestion points, and rerouting strategies is essential for:

- Infrastructure planning  
- Capacity management  
- Risk and disruption analysis  

This simulation provides a simplified but realistic representation of these dynamics.
